## Journal 11/1/25:
This new website is a revised and improved version of my current website.
## Journal 11/13/25:
I have only done a basic setup so far.
my architecture is:
```
index.html
styles/
    styles.css
scripts/
    main.js
```
```index.html``` is the main page.\
```styles/styles.css``` is the main stylesheet for aspects of the page.\
I don't know what ```scripts/main.js``` is for yet but I know I need something javascript based.\
In `index.html` I have made a html preamble to define the page and made a 
html section where the language is defined as english.\
Additionally, the metadata section has it set that the default character set is 
UTF-8 like usual and name as viewport to define the visible area for the page, 
with the width being that of the observing device and a normal scaling.\
I couldn't come up with a better title, so I made the title "Web Development Final Project".
